# markerfinder-euk
This is a variation on the regular markerfinder script that can recover the three different eukaryotic RNAP variants

The original markerfinder script was written to provide a simple automated tool for recovering highly-conserved bacterial and archaeal marker genes and generating concatenated alignments that could then be used in phylogenetic inference (see https://github.com/faylward/markerfinder). 

Eukaryotes have multiple versions of RNAP, and so the initial version of markerfinder could not predict them and put them in a concatenated alignment. This tool what therefore modified to provide this workflow.
